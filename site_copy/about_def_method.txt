Method approach is unlike many you'll see. We are equally passionate about
software quality as we are about business success. Here is a list of just
some of the services Def Method provides:

- technical evaluation of your business goals. Do you have the right team
  in place to achieve your business goals? If not, what can be changed?
  What is your current capacity and how can it be boosted using the
  resources you have right now?

  - software development process improvement. Many companies implement
  software practices like SCRUM, Agile, or XP. These are great buzzwords
  and make for great books, but how well does your team execute best
  practices to achieve results? Are these technical achievements right
  for your company? How can you use metrics like code quality and
  velocity to achieve measurable technical success?

  - test and behavior driven development. You've heard of TDD/BDD, or
  maybe you're already convinced it's the best thing for your team. So
  how do you implement it? How do you make it catch on in your
  development team? Def Method has been there, and has the right tools
  for the job.

  location, and skill level, Def Method takes a particular pride in
