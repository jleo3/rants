I need terms to describe myself and my developers. They are not employees. My favorite ideas so far have centered around the music business, and this actually works with the company's title, Def Method. People think about Def Leppard and Def Jam, both representative of the music industry. I'll take either allusion.

I have several roles in the industry. I'm a program director - that's from radio stations. An A&R rep can be a euphemism for HR. I don't want to call my developers "artists," though. They're not recording artists, sound engineers, production designers (?). Executive producer could work for me. Creative director, maybe. I like program director more and more, since we're actually writing programs.

There's also the concept of mastering, used to describe what happens during the post-production process.

Ooh, then there's composers. Def Method composers and program directors (me).
