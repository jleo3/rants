Building Partnerships

Woudn't it be great if you had an experienced engineer in your corner, someone who can act as technical advisor, understand your business needs and find and implement the right technical solution? Wouldn't you love to have a programmer who can make sure your business stays on target and your engineering team executes at a high level at all times?

Finally, wouldn't you love it if that person partnered with you, investing themselves in your project rather than simply throwing resources at the problem?
